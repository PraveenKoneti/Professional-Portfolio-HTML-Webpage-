# Professional-Portfolio-HTML-Webpage-

 Select and Copy the code from the Professional-Portfolio-HTML-Webpage.
 Save the file with a .html extension. 
 For example, you can save it as index.html.
 After saving your HTML file, double-click on it, or right-click and choose "Open with" and select your preferred web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.). 
 Your web browser will render the HTML code, and you'll see the output displayed in the browser window.
 That's it! You don't need to compile HTML code; you can view the output directly in a web browser.
